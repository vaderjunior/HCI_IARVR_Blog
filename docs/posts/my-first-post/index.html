  <section><p><strong>Day 1: Setting up Unity, Meta tools, and starting the Roll-a-Ball game</strong></p>
<p>Phew ‚Äî today was long, but honestly, pretty exciting.</p>
<p>I started by factory-resetting the headset because it was still logged into a previous account. I wanted to use my own Meta account, so that was necessary. After setting it up, I played around with it a bit (and so did my friends). My roommate ended up bowling in VR ‚Äî I think we‚Äôre all easily impressed üòÑ</p>
<p>Then I switched into <strong>Unity mode</strong>. I‚Äôve never worked with Unity or C# before, so everything is new. Before I dive into that though ‚Äî <strong>I set up this Hugo website yesterday!</strong> I originally tried using a fancy theme, but the dependencies were melting my brain, so I gracefully gave up and went with the <strong>Paper</strong> theme that Yara recommended. Clean, simple, works. Perfect.</p>

<h3 id="-roll-a-ball">üïπÔ∏è Roll-a-Ball</h3>
<p>The Roll-a-Ball project was provided on Moodle, but I wanted to <em>really</em> understand what was happening rather than drag-and-drop. So I followed the official Unity tutorial:</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball">https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball</a></p>
<p>I worked through the part where you set up the ground and ball:</p>
<video
  src="rollaball1.mp4"
  
  autoplay
  loop
  muted
  playsinline
  controls
  style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"
></video>

<p>The tutorial is beginner-friendly and well explained. But‚Ä¶</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-the-great-why-is-the-ball-not-moving-mystery">‚ùó The great ‚ÄúWhy is the ball not moving?‚Äù mystery</h3>
<p>When I pressed Play, <strong>the ball refused to move.</strong><br>
No errors. Just stubborn stillness.</p>
<p>So naturally I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adjusted speed values</li>
<li>Re-imported Input Manager</li>
<li>Googled way too many things</li>
<li>Checked Reddit &amp; StackOverflow</li>
<li>Considered rewriting physics myself (joking‚Ä¶ mostly)</li>
</ol>
<p>After <strong>25 minutes</strong>, I finally noticed:</p>
<p>I <strong>wasn‚Äôt pressing the arrow keys</strong> to control the ball.<br>
I was <em>just staring at it.</em> Waiting. Expecting movement.</p>
<p>So yes ‚Äî the problem was me.<br>
The ball was fine. Gravity was fine. Unity was fine.<br>
<strong>I</strong> was the bug.</p>
<hr>
<p>After that breakthrough, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up the camera to follow the ball</li>
<li>Added walls so the ball doesn‚Äôt fall off the platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step is adding collectibles and finishing the game.</p>
<p>I also installed Oculus support in Unity ‚Äî that setup was surprisingly smooth. But I‚Äôll get into VR integration <em>after</em> finishing the game logic.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, that&rsquo;s all for today.<br>
More tomorrow ‚úåÔ∏è</p>
