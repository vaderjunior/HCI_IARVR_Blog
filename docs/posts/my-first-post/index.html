<h3 id="rollaball">RollaBall</h3>
<p>The RollaBall project was provided on Moodle, but I wanted to understand it better, so I followed the official Unity tutorial:</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball">https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball</a></p>
<p>I reached the part where the ground and ball are set up.</p>

</video>
<p>Everything was going fine until I pressed Play and the ball just stayed there.<br>
No errors, no movement.</p>
<p>I tried changing the speed, reimporting input settings, and even searched online for answers. After about 25 minutes I finally realized that I never pressed the arrow keys to move the ball. I had just been staring at it, waiting for it to move by itself. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>After that I set up the camera to follow the ball and added walls so it wouldn’t fall off the platform. The next step is to add the collectibles and finish the rest of the tutorial.</p>
<p>I also added Oculus support in Unity. The setup was straightforward, but I’ll explore that more once the basic game is done.</p>
<p>That’s all for today.</p>
