      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finally started working on the &lt;code&gt;LocomotionTechnique&lt;/code&gt; script itself instead of just moving GameObjects around like Lego. It was fun to test things out on the already existing repo, Must have taken a lot of hours to make this entir thing. Just thinking about it made me motion sick :scream:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the original project the camera rig was the player. In my version the real body is &lt;code&gt;AvatarRoot&lt;/code&gt;  a capsule collider rolling through the world with a cylinder (&lt;code&gt;avatar&lt;/code&gt;) and a sphere (&lt;code&gt;airball&lt;/code&gt;) as place holder. I thought I will put in design later, incase everythign gets done by February.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was finally “hands on” instead of just thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started by forking and cloning the VR locomotion parkour repo from our course. The instructions said “open the VRParkour folder as a Unity project”, but when I did that and hit Play, the scene was completely empty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After poking around a bit I realised I had just opened a blank scene. The real content is in&#xA;Assets/Scenes/ParkourChallenge.unity. Once I opened that, suddenly the whole level, coins, banners, etc. showed up and actually ran on the Quest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 4: Thinking, thinking and more thinking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week was mostly spent on thinking and trying to work out what locomotion technique I want to use for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly I tried to remember and dig up all the things previous years’ students did, not just to be inspired but to do something that is different from what they have done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I tried familiarising myself with the whole Unity and locomotion system in general.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The video and playlist below were super useful. The guy is fun to listen to and overall I learned how to calibrate the controller feedback to actual input for movement and how to fine tune it. Even though everything is not clear I thought I would look up more when I actually start the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 2-5: Finishing up the game and Playing it in VR</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to post only when I hit a real milestone instead of spamming daily logs. This one bundles a few action-packed days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enemies + first chaos&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I added an enemy that chases the player ball using a &lt;code&gt;NavMeshAgent&lt;/code&gt;. Looked great… until it started orbiting me and occasionally ghosted through walls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason&lt;/strong&gt;:My enemy had a visible child (EnemyBody) offset from the parent that holds the &lt;code&gt;NavMeshAgent&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Fix&lt;/strong&gt;: created a clean hierarchy Enemy (parent with Agent) → EnemyBody (mesh), then Reset the child to (0,0,0).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 1: Setting up Unity, Meta tools, and starting the Roll-a-Ball game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phew, today was long but really productive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started by factory resetting the headset because it was still logged into an old account. I wanted to use my own Meta account, so I set it up again. After that I tried it out for a bit and let my friends do the same. My roommate played bowling in VR and we all had a good laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later I moved on to learning Unity and some C#, both completely new to me. Before that, I had finished setting up this Hugo website yesterday. I first tried a fancy theme, but it needed too many extra things, so I switched to the Paper theme that Yara recommended. It was simple and worked right away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
