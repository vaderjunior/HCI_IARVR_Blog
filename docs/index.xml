      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phew, today was long but really productive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started by factory resetting the headset because it was still logged into an old account. I wanted to use my own Meta account, so I set it up again. After that I tried it out for a bit and let my friends do the same. My roommate played bowling in VR and we all had a good laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later I moved on to learning Unity and some C#, both completely new to me. Before that, I had finished setting up this Hugo website yesterday. I first tried a fancy theme, but it needed too many extra things, so I switched to the Paper theme that Yara recommended. It was simple and worked right away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
